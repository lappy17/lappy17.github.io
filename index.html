<h1>No Man Is An Island, by John Donne</h1>
<p>No man is an island,</p>
<p>Entire of itself,</p>
<p>Every man is a piece of the continent,</p>
<p>A part of the main.</p>
<p>If a clod be washed away by the sea,</p>
<p>Europe is the less.</p>
<p>As well as if a promontory were.</p>
<p>As well as if a manor of thy friend</p>
<p>Or of thine own were:</p>
<p>Any man death diminishes me,</p>
<p>Because I am involved in mankind,</p>
<p>And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;</p>
<p>It tolls for thee.</p>
